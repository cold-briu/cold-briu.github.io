                    start by cracking 2-3 eggs into a bowl and whisking them together with a
                    fork or
                    whisk until the yolks and whites are well combined. Season the eggs with a pinch of salt and

                    </b>,
                    and add
                    a splash of milk or cream if desired. Heat a non-stick pan over medium heat and add a knob of

                        butter
                    </b>. Once
                    the butter has melted and is sizzling, pour in the beaten eggs. Use a spatula to gently push the
                    eggs around
                    the pan, creating large, soft curds. Continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until the eggs are
                    set
                    but
                    still moist, about 2-3 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and serve the scrambled eggs
                    immediately,
                    garnished with chopped fresh herbs like chives or parsley if desired.
